# URL Content Downloader

This Python script downloads content from a given URL and saves it to a specified folder. The script is designed to download image files (e.g., JPG, PNG) and save them to your local storage. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, allowing you to enter the URL and select a destination folder for the downloaded content.

## Features

- **Download Images**: Automatically detects image files based on the URL's content type (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- **Save to Custom Folder**: Allows you to specify the folder where the downloaded file will be saved.
- **Threaded Downloading**: Uses threading to avoid blocking the GUI while the file is being downloaded.
- **Simple GUI**: The GUI provides input fields for the URL and destination folder, and a button to start the download.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library for downloading content from URLs.
- `tkinter` library for the GUI (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
